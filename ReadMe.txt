My program use python 3 to run, I use python3 smartclient.py to start the code, it will ask user to enter a webside first, and it will check if it is a webside or not,if it is not a webside, it will show user"You enter something which is not a webside or something wrong, please check if it correct webside or use ctrl+c to end", user can keep try to enter webside or use ctrl+c to stop. After user enter a webside which can pass, it will show as below
webside:XXXXXXXXXXX
1.Supports http2:yes/no
2.List of Cookies:
cookie name: XXXX; expire time: XXXX; domain name:XXXX
3.Password-protected:yes/no

The webside is what user enter, the supports will show if it support http2 or not, and the list of cookies will show the cookies in that order:cookie name(if have);expire time(if have); domain name(if have); separate with';',and the last thing it will show if it is password-protected. That is all about my program, thanks for reading.
